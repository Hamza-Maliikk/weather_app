<h1>🌤 Weather App</h1>

This is a beginner-friendly weather app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With its clean and minimal design, it makes checking the current weather of any city quick and simple.

✨ What it does

🖥 Simple interface that’s easy to use

🌡 Dynamic backgrounds that change based on the temperature or weather

🏙 City search with validation so empty or invalid inputs are handled smoothly

📊 Shows temperature, weather condition, and a short description

⏰ Displays the date and time for the searched city

🛠 Built with

HTML5 for the structure

CSS3 for styling and background effects

JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity and API handling

OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data

👉 It’s a small project, but it was a great way to practice working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and dynamic styling in JavaScript.
